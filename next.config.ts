 *
 * The rest of the headers are straight blocks, safe to enforce today:
 *   - HSTS: only meaningful on HTTPS (no-op on http://localhost).
 *   - X-Content-Type-Options / X-Frame-Options / Referrer-Policy:
 *     baseline OWASP hardening, no behavioural cost.
 *   - Permissions-Policy: we don't use camera / microphone / etc, so
 *     deny them. A supply-chain compromise or a forgotten plugin
 *     can't silently opt back in.

  /**
   * Cache-Control policy.
   *
   * Why this exists:
   *   Hostinger's CDN was applying `s-maxage=31536000` (1 year) to
   *   prerendered HTML pages by default. When a new deploy shipped
   *   fresh Turbopack chunk hashes, the edge kept serving year-old
   *   HTML referencing chunk filenames that no longer existed on
   *   disk — result: HTML 200, every /_next/static/*.js and .css
   *   came back 404, the page rendered unstyled. Private/incognito
   *   did nothing because the cache is server-side.
   *
   * Strategy:
   *   - /_next/static/* — leave to Next. Turbopack dev chunks can go
   *     stale if we force immutable caching here; Next already emits
   *     the correct production headers for hashed assets.
   *   - /api/*          — no-store. API responses are per-user and
   *     must never be shared across requests at the edge.
   *   - Everything else — public, brief s-maxage + generous
   *     stale-while-revalidate. The edge serves instantly from cache
   *     for the first 5 min, then returns cached content while
   *     refreshing in the background for up to 24 h. A deploy's
   *     chunk-hash drift self-heals within ~5 min with no user-
   *     visible latency.
   *
   *   - authenticated app routes — `private, no-store`. See below.
   *
   * Why the authenticated routes are carved out (issue: raw RSC
   * payload rendered as text on /dashboard)
   *
   *   The note that used to sit here claimed the dashboard routes were
   *   "server-rendered per request" and therefore safe from a shared
   *   cache. They are not: they are client components, so Next
   *   prerenders their shell as STATIC (`○` in the build output) and
   *   this rule then stamped `public, s-maxage=300,
   *   stale-while-revalidate=86400` on them.
   *
   *   One URL, two very different responses: a browser navigation gets
   *   HTML, while the App Router's own fetches (prefetch, client
   *   navigation) get the RSC flight payload for the SAME path,
   *   distinguished only by the `RSC` request header. Next says so via
   *   `Vary: RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, …` — but a CDN that ignores
   *   Vary (Hostinger's does, which is the same edge that caused the
   *   stale-chunk incident above) keys both on the path alone.
   *   Whichever response lands in the cache first is served to
   *   everyone for the next 5 minutes — and for up to 24 h more while
   *   it revalidates.
   *
   *   When the flight payload wins that race, the next person to open
   *   /dashboard receives it AS THE DOCUMENT: a page of
   *   `0:{"tree":…,"buildId":…}` and no HTML at all. Nothing throws,
   *   which is why the error boundaries added for this symptom never
   *   caught it — the application never ran.
   *
   *   `no-store` on every authenticated path removes the shared cache
   *   from the equation entirely. These pages are per-user and behind
   *   a session; there was never anything to gain by caching them at
   *   the edge.
   *
   * Security headers are appended via a separate catch-all rule
   * below — Next.js merges headers from every matching rule, so
   * they apply to every response regardless of which cache rule
   * matched.
